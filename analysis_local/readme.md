# Analysis Local Instruction

Don't want to go through all the trouble of setting up redshift but still interested in seeing what the mortgage data is showing us? No problem! This program runs on your local machine and will generate a thorough report for a specific year or quarter that you downloaded.

In order to run the analysis, specify the path of the files. The program will track down all the available records of every single borrower and aggregate their behavior into one single row within that particular time window that you have on files.

Note that the Harp file is still quite big(17GB), the analysis may take from 30 mins to 1 hour to finish dependes on how many loans fannie and freddie acquired that year.
