# Project Mortgage

![](docs/mortgage_ecosystem.png)

Introduction:
Since the 2008 housing crisis and the near 200 billion dollar government bailout, monitoring the healthiness of the current mortgage market should be a public concern. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are the two biggest, government associated entities that acquire and trade housing mortegage as securities. They publish a big subset of their actual acquisitions and their performance throughout the years to provide transparency to the investors, also for anyone who are interested in digging into the nitty gritty details for research and education purpose. However, the sheer volumn of the data, the complicated nature of mortgage loans being such a sophisticated financial product make it very difficult to generate any immeciate insight.

In this distributing data warehouse project, I used S3 as my data lake to pull in the entirety of the 300 GB raw data, then ingest them into AWS Redshift as a few master tables detailing each loan's origination and their performance through out their life cyle.

## Trade-offsS
AWS redshift is not an free tier available option. But its massive paralled processing power is the ideal choice for this project.
